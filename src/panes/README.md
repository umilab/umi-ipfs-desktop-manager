# Panes

A pane is a piece of information that is used within a [screen](../screens). They must only
be imported by screens and they only use [components](../components). All of them use the component [Pane](../components/view/pane.js) and
they must be wrapped by a [PaneContainer](../components/view/pane-container.js).
